# 🍹 Beverage Maker - OOP Project

## 📝 Overview

This project is a simple simulation of a beverage vending machine built using basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++.  
It models different types of drinks and their ingredients, showing how OOP helps organize code with reusable and extendable parts.

## 🚀 What the project does

- Allows you to create different beverages like ☕ coffee or 🍵 tea.
- Uses **classes** to represent drinks and their ingredients.
- Demonstrates key OOP ideas such as:
  - **Classes and Objects:** Blueprints and instances of drinks 🏗️.
  - **Inheritance:** Creating specialized drink types from a general drink 🌳.
  - **Polymorphism:** Treating different drinks in a unified way 🔄.
- Simulates preparing a drink by combining ingredients 🥤.

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- Language: C++
- Programming paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 💻
- Development tools: Visual Studio 🖥️
